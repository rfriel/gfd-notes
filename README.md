(Very) unfinished notes on geophysical fluid dynamics

In my first year of grad school, I whimsically decided to write a sort of mini-textbook on geophysical fluid dynamics, largely as a way of helping myself learn the subject.  I ended up dropping the project before I had written very much, but I've put [the little that I did write](https://github.com/rfriel/gfd-notes/blob/master/gfd-notes.pdf) in this public repo in case it's of any interest.  (The section on scaling arguments is a lot more explicit than the presentations I've seen in textbooks, and I think I would have benefitted from a similarly explicit account when I was first learning the concept.)  Maybe I will finish it sometime.
